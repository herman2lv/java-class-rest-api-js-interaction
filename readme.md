# Java Class - Training Course

## JS + REST API + view Demo

#### Author: Herman Rabinkin

This repository contains examples which can help to explain and understand basic Spring MVC + REST configuration as well
as way of interaction between Front-End and Back-End via REST endpoints and simple JavaScript

It is simple CRUD web-service serving both data via rest endpoints `"/api/books/**` as well as serverside rendered view
html pages `"/books/**`.

Main pages rendered with JS and communicate with server using AJAX requests. 
In order to reduce boilerplate code JQuery is used.
